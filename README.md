A game to use to visualize and solve the problem from part 2 of day 22 of Advent of Code 2016.

Starting from the light-blue cell, use arrow keys to move to the G. Moving onto a cell displaces that cell's contents to your previous position.

The object is to move the G onto the upper-left cell.

Cmd-Z to undo.
Shortcut: "j" to do a clockwise loop (down, left, left, up, right).
